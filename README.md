Project Natures

Maven 
Apache Maven is a software project management and comprehension tool. Based on the concept of a project object model (POM), Maven can manage a project's build, reporting and documentation from a central piece of information. https://maven.apache.org/

REST Assured 
Testing and validating REST services in Java is harder than in dynamic languages such as Ruby and Groovy. REST Assured brings the simplicity of using these languages into the Java domain. http://rest-assured.io/

Jackson 
Jackson is a high-performance JSON processor for Java. Its developers extol the combination of fast, correct, lightweight, and ergonomic attributes of the library. https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson

TestNG is a testing framework inspired from JUnit and NUnit.It is an open-source automated testing framework; where NG of TestNG means Next Generation. TestNG is similar to JUnit but it is much more powerful than JUnit but still, itâ€™s inspired by JUnit. It is designed to be better than JUnit, especially when testing integrated classes. Pay special thanks to Cedric Beust who is the creator of TestNG.
